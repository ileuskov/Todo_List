Hello there! This is a Todo List project. 

This small app can:

1) Add new Todos via typing them into the input box and pressing enter
2) Checking out Todos that are done by clicking on them. This add a strikethrough effect and a green color
3) Deleting Todos that are not needed anymore
4) Toggling out the input box by clicking on the plus icon in the top right corner of the app box

The app is made with:
1) HTML, 
2) CSS,
3) JS,
4) and jQuery

This is a small app that I made during the Web development course from Colt Steel at Udemy. The main idea behind this project was to get more comfortable with jQuery DOM methods instead of using the vanilla JS. 

The page is fully responsive and can be read comfortably from any screen. 
Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
